<h3><p><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>’S INTERVIEW WITH <span class="personal-name">QUAIBU</span> UPON THE SUBJECT OF HIS IMPENDING MARRIAGE </p></h3>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 30tfi January 1886 </p></h4> 

<p>‘So my dear friend, yon have gone and done it; I am surprised and astonished at you, I certainly gave you more credit for a good share of common sense, and sufficient knowledge of the world. Is it possible, and can it be true that it was yours the banns, that was published in the chapel yesterday?’ This was uttered by a man of about forty five years, strong but slenderly built, and of middle stature; complexion sallow red, his eyes were keen but yet seldom look you twice in the face, and his features regular. His manners were grave, but a more jovial and sincere friend never lived. In his youth he had the advantage of the best English education; besides being a good Latin, Greek and Hebrew scholar. <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>, the name of this gentleman, was not a bachelor, yet he was married, he had several wives; two he had living with him in his own house; the rest lived in their own houses, and it is strange to say that he lived happily with them all.</p> 




<p>Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, the hero of this tale, was a man who had just entered his fortieth year short and slenderly built, healthy and strong. His features were not different from any of his countrymen’s - real type of a negro. He also had the advantage of English education, moved in the highest society, both European and native, and at the time that this tale was commenced he was filling a post -which was worth to him several hundred pounds sterling a year.</p>  

<p>These two gentlemen were fast friends, so strong was their friendship that not a day passed but what you would see them together. No wonder therefore that Mr <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span> used such familiar terms to his friend <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.  </p>

<p>‘Gently, <span class="personal-name">Bonsoe Penin</span>,’ replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‘Not -so fast. Take a seat and cool yourself with a glass of Moselle and soda before you attempt to talk, as you are burning with heat. It is thus that I punish you for your hard words. After you have rested we will find time to talk about the matter and any amount of nonsense you like.’ </p>

<p> ‘By — ! <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> you are really provoking! I swear that 1 will not sit down, nor allow myself to be insulted by your offer of drink until you have satisfied me. Was the banns published yours and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>’s?’ replied <span class="personal-name-3"><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span></span> persistently. </p>

<p> ‘Yes, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, are you satisfied now? or rather, are you in such a state as would admit of your taking a “shot” now before talking.’ </p>

<p><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> here took a seat on the other side of the table at which he met his friend sitting and writing his books. Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> called for a bottle of Moselle and two of soda and glasses. The boy took off the wines, placed the bottles on the tables and then retired leaving the two friends to enjoy themselves. ‘How clumsy you are today <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>’, exclaimed <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> getting up suddenly. ‘By Jove! you have wet me all over. On my clean shirt and collar! and I am due the court in twenty minutes time, and His Honour the Chief Justice is so provokingly punctual! Where the d— am I going to get a change of shirt? And the court is fully 15 minutes ride from here. I wish I never allowed myself to be tempted by this accursed drink. What must I do, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?’ </p>

<p>I will lend you a shirt, old fellow and a dozen collars if you like,’ replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> laughing. </p>

<p>‘Pooh, man your shirt wont fit me, it will choke me. I will none of your babyish shirts, especially in court and to-day too when I have to defend a poor murderer and have to do all I can to save the poor man’s innocent neck from coming into close proximity with the hangman’s noose.’ </p> 

<p>‘No, no, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, I would rather play truant to-day from Court and endure his Honour’s reprimand tomorrow than lose my client’s cause, which I would certainly do were I to go to Court to-day with your shirt on.’</p> 

<p>‘Boy! boy!’ called Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to his servant; ‘bring another bottle of Moselle. I must say <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, if your “learned self,” instead of apparel, had shown such a great aptitude for drinking to-day I would certainly be glad. See there is not a drop of wine left in the bottle and we are still dry. You will open the second bottle, and after we have had our first shot you will indite a letter to His Honour to postpone the hearing of your case until tomorrow; after which we will have time to talk freely and uninterruptedly.’ </p> 

<p> <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> here upon indited a letter to His Honour assigning other reasons than that which was the true cause of his inability to attend the Court; and after despatching it by his own boy, sat down minus coat as contented as if no mishap had taken place and the two friends commenced talking seriously together</p>.

<h4><p>Western Echo, I0h February 1886 </p></h4> 

<p>We must now leave these two gentlemen, and introduce the heroine of this tale to the reader. Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, at the time that this tale commenced was a woman of about four and twenty years old; in stature she was short, but proportionably well built; she was neither stout nor thin, although she had a tendency towards stoutness. Her features were not very regular but extremely pleasing; her gait or steps were faultless, and she has a way of carrying herself among her own class — the uneducated women — that she is everywhere considered to be equal if not superior to any of her companions. It is only in company of educated ladies that she exhibits a consciousness of inferiority. Coupled with these natural advantages she has a strong and well regulated mind which wanted only education to have made her perfect. In fact she was a woman gifted by nature to adorn any (XP society if she had been cultured. Was it to be wondered at that Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became fascinated by her even in spite of her want of education, and the occasional burst of temper which she exhibited. Love is blind, and in the case of Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> as well as Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>’s, <span class="personal-name-cupid"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid" target="_blank">Cupid</a></span> never played a severer trick upon two fools. </p>

<p>Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had lived as man and wife for more than eight years, enjoying all the, blessings of married life. Mr <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> showed the same amount of respect for his lady as he would have shown had their marriage been solemnized in the Church. He stuck to her alone and would on no account take or keep any other woman. Every lady respected her as if a minister had joined them together in holy wedlock. Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> on her part honoured and above all obeyed Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> in every thing and at all times. She felt great interest in her good man’s affairs, which she in every way considered as her own. In fact, no two persons that have been united together by the church could have lived more happily together than those two who were only married by country marriage,10 a marriage looked down upon as debasing and degrading. </p>

<p> I may add that although Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and his wife attended chapel and were <span class="personal-name-christians"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians" target="_blank">Christians</a></span>, nominally, since they were not class members," yet the gentleman through reasons of his own would never be induced to attend class meetings. As for the lady she never knew what it was, until Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> the minister's wife and her husband who was a friend of Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> thought it a duty incumbent upon them to endeavour to convert her. They accordingly got her to enter her name in the class list, and in course of time was baptized and duly became a member of the <span class="place-name-wesleyan"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_theology" target="_blank">Wesleyan</a></span> body; Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> seeing no fault in the step having given his consent thereto previously. From that day things began to wear a different aspect; Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> visibly changed. What delighted her before became sin in her eyes. Those innocent and harmless pleasures that used to amuse her were considered by her as sinful; she became moody, discontented and restless. She would, for hours, go to the minister’s house and come home looking as if something was troubling her mind. To Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>’s inquiries as to her change of conduct and behaviour, she would reply ‘nothing.’ In the meantime Rev: Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> became assiduous in pressing Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to become a class member, as [Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had been, and that it only wanted that to make <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> and himself happy in their marriage life. Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could not well see through that, for had he not lived with his wife more than eight years happily and in the most agreeable manner? From that day he saw and deeply felt that the heart of his lady as well as her love and affections had been taken away from him, and by a certain mistaken notion of christian religion. Henceforward he must make up his mind to lead a miserable life with her he loved, unless he turned her away at once or became a class member himself. Things were in this state when a European minister arrived who took charge of the station and Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> became his assistant. Rev Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became friends, and in a short time their friendship developed into intimacy. Religion formed principally the subject of their conversation; and after a time Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> was induced to promise and ultimately become a class member, having for leader his friend Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>. </p>

<p>If his obstinacy to be a class member was the cause of the change of con- duct in Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had cause to rejoice when he enrolled his name as a member of the Wesleyan Society; for the same spirit of contentment, love and happiness that ruled in their domestic hearth before Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> became a member returned and they lived happily together again. But the two ministers had not finished with them yet. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> must give to his wife a ring through a minister, before God and in the open chapel; in fine they must enter into the ‘Holy state of matrimony’ before they could be admitted as full members of the society. In for a penny, in for a pound. The lady was willing, her people were willing; <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had to consult nobody, and there was ‘no just cause or impediment’ why he also should not be willing; for had he not lived for several years happily together with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>? Before God, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> conscientiously considered Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> legally his wife although no minister had married them. He had not the least doubt that God, the searcher of hearts considered them as man and wife; and if it only wanted the mere putting on of a ring on the part of the woman to make their marriage legal in the eyes of men, well, he must conform to it: and the announcement of their banns was accordingly published in the Sunday previous to the day Bonsoe Pennin called on his friend Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> in the great trepidation and astonishment mentioned at the opening of this chapter. </p>

<h2><p>CHAPTER II </p></h2>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 24th February 1886 </p></h4>

<p> ‘Where is <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?’ inquired <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> of his friend. I seldom see her lately; she used to call very often at my house to see her friends; but it seems to me that she avoids the place now. What can be the matter, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>?’  </p>

<p>‘I really do not know;’ replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; ‘unless because she is now a class member, and the duty attached to her spiritual concerns gives hei no time to call. Mrs D your wife was here the day before yesterday, and remained several hours with her chatting together.’ </p> 

<p>‘Do you really mean,’ asked <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> in astonishment, ‘that Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is now a class member? and who is her leader?’</p> 

<p>‘I mean not only to tell you that <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is a member,’ returned <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‘but I also am a member on trial; and when you heard somebody’s banns being published yesterday in chapel it was mine. Now you see my dear <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> that I HAVE GONE AND DONE IT.’ </p>

 <p>This news, true as it was, did not a little startle Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. For some minutes he could not open his mouth, but sat down in the utmost astonishment, looking at his friend. At last ne said: </p> 

<p>‘Words fail me to express my sentiments; allow me to congratulate you. I must candidly say, however, that I would never, under the penalty of decapitation, sacrifice my happiness; all the gold of <span class="place-name-ophir"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophir" target="_blank">Ophir</a></span> could not induce me to sell my liberty and happiness thus. What madness! what fetich could they have played on you so as to take such a step! Well, I am blessed, if I could make out the motives which could have prompted you to take a step of which I am sure, knowing what you are, you will soon repent. Chacun a son gout. I will promise you this much <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; if you succeed in keeping your position as al class member, for three months, telling your real feelings to a frail man like yourself, and who is in no way better, I mean your class leader, 1 will also become a member. No, no, you can’t remain with them even a month I am sure. And this matrimonial project of yours, have you seriously thought over it? Have you thought of the consequences? Have you studied Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> so well . as she was, as she is; and as she will be in the state to which you are going to  raise her? Certain it is that she has been to you, what any good woman could A well be. chaste, prudent, loving, and obedient. But are you sure that Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, as a country-married woman will be the same Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. as a church married lady, both of you living in enchained wedlock? Have you taken into" </p>

<p>Deep consideration the similarity of feelings, or of mind, of education and training; the kind of love which binds two together, whether in prosperity or in adversity; and of the entire dependence on the part of the woman upon the man, which alone could make the new life into which you are drifting yourself and the lady happy?. Pause, ponder, and consider well the serious step you are about taking before its too late. These are not mere words prompted by a spirit of egotism; “once bit, twice shy” and experience teaches knowledge. The flames about which you are, moth-like fluttering, will certainly burn you, as it burnt me to my cost. As a young man, when I first came out from <span Class-"place-name-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" target="_blank">England</a>England</span>, I was induced to marry in the church, the daughter of one of the highest gentlemen in the country. But oh! What a most miserable life we led I took the bull by the horns, and broke the ring that united us. I followed the fashion of my country, and I am as you find me, happy. Forgive the liberty 1 have taken in talking so freely to you. If I have gone beyond the limits of friendship know that it is pure nature that prompted me.’</p>

I took the bull by the horns, and broke the ring that united us. I followed the fashion of my country, and I am as you find me, happy.  </p>

<p> Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> was, in the utmost degree, 'perplexed; he saw that his darling structure was tottering; the axe which Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> wielded so well was doing all possible mischief to his enchanted edifice, and unless he made some desperate stand he would find his sweet hopes of unalloyed happiness in the new marriage scattered to the winds. He would rather make a leap in the dark, probably he might not find it so bad as his friend had depicted, than to subject himself and his darling <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> to the ridicule, and contempt of the people. As a man, determined to take the consequences of his act, however painful it may be, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> replied in the following manner: ‘My most esteemed friend; today you have shown me the real worth of friendship, and yourself more than a friend; you are indeed my mentor. I will not disguise from you that I have had myself  forebodings of evil. Examples are not wanting to convince me of the frightful abyss into which I am plunging myself and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> ln my own family, there is my own father, and my foster-uncle, both of who were living happily with their wives, until Christianity, which they afterwards embraced, compelled them to take unto themselves new wives and marry them according to the Church. In their hearts, they soon repented as was evident by the continuous bickerings and rows, as also the consequent illegal separation that ‘took place between them and their wives. Outside my own family, there are scores of others who are living witnesses and examples. It is the knowledge I have of the step 1 am taking with my eyes open, which is the cause of my appreciating  the sincerity of your friendship. Some sages say that man is a free agent; others say that he is others say that he is not. Whether man is or is not a free agent I am not in a position to say; but situated as I am now I cannot help saying that I am not a free agent. Defects in my wife which are dormant in our present life can plainly see will be roused up like a roaring lion to devour poor me; tempers and evil passions in her which are now varnished and glided with gold may turn a corroding iron to eat up my very soul1 know all these, and moreover I am not unaware that it is by far better to deal with certainties than with things the nature and the result of which is doubtful. If I were free to study my own as well as her future happiness I would certainly stop short and brave the ridicule and contempt of friends and neighbours: but as I said before I am not a free agent in this matter; there is something which is pressing me onwards; there is no retracing my steps, but I must submit to my fate. May God in his mercy help her and me also.’ </p>

<p>‘I cannot but honour the feelings which prompt you to take such a suicidal step,’ returned Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‘As you are determined and cannot be persuaded, I can only pity you, and blame the parsons whose duty should have been to diffuse happiness, as ministers of God, amongst the people instead of blindly forcing them into certain misery and distress.’</p>  

<p>‘There comes <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>!’ exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; accompanied by Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and escorted by the Reverend gentleman himself. Poor girl she does not know her position yet.’</p>

<p>‘Which of the parsons?’ inquired Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>.  </p>

<p>‘Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,’ replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; then, continuing, he thus cautioned his friend. ‘Now old fellow, we must be careful what we say in the presence of this man. The subject which has been occupying our time is too serious, and at the same time delicate for us to resume it: so let us drop it, at all events for the present; for I know your temper and it will do no good but a great deal of harm to parties concerned.’ </p> 

  

<h2><p>CHAPTER III </p></h2> 

<h4><p>Western Echo, 6th March 1886  </p></h4>

<p>‘Leave me alone to myself,’ replied Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> helping himself to a glass of <span class="place-name-moselle-wine"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moselle_wine" target="_blank">Moselle wine</a></span>. ‘His Reverence and lady are cousins of mine, and they know me too well to take umbrage at anything that I choose to say to them. How are you Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?’ continued he, addressing himself to the lady. ‘It is sometime since I saw you. So you have been taken in hand by my dear cousins, and are being led by them to the place where you should go; and poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> too has ' cast behind him the world and all its vanity and is ready to follow you wither- soever my godly relatives will choose to lead you. Poor guileless girl! and poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>’s helpless.’</p> 

<p> ‘Why do you call Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> poor, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>?’ Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> asked. ‘Is it because he was elected to forsake the world, the flesh and the devil, and join The people of God that he becomes poor?16 Know that he is richer by far now than what he could ever have been before he enlisted under the banner of the Lord. I wish I could get you also to enlist. What a bright example you too would set, and I would fain ask, nay beseech, you to follow this worthy step so nobly taken by your friend.’ </p>

 <p>‘Oh I see that the right hand has not lost its cunning yet!’17 exclaimed Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> with a certain amount of sneer in his face, and in the way how he expressed the words. ‘Do you know what I was telling my friend <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> before you came? Now <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,’ continued he, addressing himself to his friend, ‘What was it that I told you that I would do were you to continue three months a feeling telling Christian? Out with it.’</p> 

 <p>‘That you would follow me, and become a class member too,’ replied Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. ‘But I am afraid you will never become one, since you make your enlistment dependent upon my continuance in that body.’ </p> 

<p>‘Do I see Philip in himself again?’ exclaimed Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>, ‘now that I have heard you.’</p>  

<p>‘Say what you wished me to tell Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> which I have truthfully told him, 1 sincerely hope you will put all joking aside,’ interrupted Mr <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> smiling. ‘What do you mean <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>’ joined in Rev <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> a little warmly. ‘Would you joke in a matter of such vital importance to such a man as this? Fie! 1 really — ’ </p> 

<p>‘Joking!’ interrupted Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‘Who talks about jokes when a fellow is talking to your Reverend self? I never was so serious in my life. But I must candidly say that if my friend here become wise during the three months, by being turned out of, or leaves, the body of his own free will and accord I certainly would not be a fool to join it, my honoured cousin.’ </p> 

<p>Here, Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seeing that her cousin Bonsoe was making a fool of her husband, a habit which <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> had got and used unmercifully when he got a chance, called upon that amiable cousin of hers to have done with it. She then inquired after his wives and children at home.  </p>

<p>‘My wives are all well,’ replied Mr<span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> good humouredly, ‘and the young ones stunning. But why do you enquire after my wives? Are they not abominations in your side, my sweet cousin?’ </p>

 <p>‘How very strange and wild you do talk to-day, cousin,’ replied Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> looking rather surprised. ‘Your wives abominations to me well I never. How long is it since stupid notions of this sort came into your mind?’</p>  

<p>‘Only to-day my dear cousin, only to-day,’ replied he, not a little touched by Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>’s words. Then all of a sudden he assumed a serious tone, laying emphasis on each word he uttered; and looking at his two relatives with an intensity of gaze peculiar to persons who are not in the habit of looking at people twice in the face, continued; ‘If country marriages are abominations in the sight of God and consequently to you and your body, the wives whom, as you are-aware I married according to country fashion, could not but be an abomination.  Am I right? <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>! Have I explained myself rightly?’ 

 <p>‘I really cannot say,’ the Revd gentleman replied. ‘But it looks to me and to all right minded men, that it is better and more respectable to have but one wife, married in the church. Is it not so mentioned in Holy Writ? Why is it only to-day that you talk about your wives? Have we ever found fault with either your- self or them to your knowledge?’ ‘You have certainly never found fault with me and with them, as you say, to my knowledge,’ replied <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> hotly; ‘and never will if I can help myself. But’, continued he rather complacently, ‘look at our mutual friend <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> and his amiable wife; is it because you find fault with them or that they have lived unhappily together, or that they were not looked upon by European gentlemen as well as native and even by men of “your cloth” as respectable in their native or country married state, that they are now made to exchange sub- stance - real happiness - for a shadow?’. </p>

<h2><p>CHAPTER IV </p></h2> 

<h3><p>THE <span class="personal-name-4">PRITZIA'S</span> - HUSBAND AND WIFE AND MISS <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span></p> </h3> 

<h4><p>Western Echo, 17th March 1886</p></h4> 

<p>In the last chapter we mentioned that <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> called over to see Mr & Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and also mentioned somewhere that she had been of late in the habit of going there frequently. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, as has been intimated before, was a - Wesleyan minister, a zealous man of the old school. He was one of the trained men Revd. Mr <span class="personal-name-20">Fitzmaurice </span>brought up in the ministry. If he was deficient in education and could barely read and write and with difficulty speak the English language, he was nevertheless a very good man, and able speaker, was successful in gaining souls in his ministrations, and moreover for a native he was| liberal in his religious tenets. As he made no ostentatious displays of religion in conversation, as some of his cloth did; and knew when and how to introduce religious matter in conversation and when to talk about other subjects, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> found great delight in the Rev. gentleman’s company, and from mere acquaintance they became very good friends. It was his habit to call upon Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> frequently and on these occasions religion formed the principle topic of conversation, although other subjects were taken in hand too. As were the men so also became the women, and Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> became also intimate.</p>  

<p>One evening as the Revd. gentleman and his spouse were chatting together in their house, Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and several friends, among whom were some Europeans, passed by. These jovial friends had been enjoying themselves during the day, going from house to house, and at the time they passed the minister’s house they were each and all, ‘three sheets in the wind.’</p> 

<p>‘What a pity,’ cried Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> to her husband, ‘Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> should be under such corrupting influences home he is always quiet, and busy at his work. If his friends would leave him alone, you as a minister could never find a better man to associate with. It is not becoming, as a minister and preacher of the gospel, to have such a worldly man as a friend. Can you not get him to join the society?  Joining the Society’ means, with the Christians of the Wesleyan body, to become a class member.  ‘My dear Mary,’ replied Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, assuming a dignified and clerical air peculiar to him, ‘do you think I have been so long on intimate terms with Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> without exercising the sacred prerogative which God, in his grace, has I granted me to use, in order to recover miserable souls subjected to Satan and under his thraldom? Many a day have I had a talk with him on the subject of his soul's salvation, and of the necessity of his enlisting as a class member, which course alone, and no other way, could entitle him to be considered a good man, and a reformed christian. But the man has a peculiar way of repelling me whenever I speak to him about class meetings. He has such an aversion to the thing, so much so that I am afraid he will go to hell like several of his clique, if the way to heaven is only through being a class member. I have done all I can to him, and to no purpose. </p>

<p>'Have you then decided,' rejoined Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, 'to leave the poor man with Satan? It would be a pity were you to lose heart in the glorious and praise- worthy step you have taken to reclaim him. Persevere John, for I know that if you succeed with him his wife will also follow. </p>

<p>It is utterly impossible!' cried Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> despairingly; 'but I can see a way of surmounting this difficulty. Through dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> we will doubtless succeed; so as early as you can manage to have time, pay her a visit to persuade her to come with you. Between the two of us we will, I am sure, be able to successfully lay siege to his religious prejudices through her and in the course of time convert him and his lady. </p>

<p>Obedient to her lord's command Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> the next day repaired to Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>'s house, and seeing Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> disengaged had some chat with her and when she was leaving managed to get her to accompany her. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seeing them quietly went to his bedroom unperceived by the ladies and there waited till he found an opportune time to come arrayed in such abillment as became his position when he wanted to covert souls. </p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 24th March 1886</p></h4> 

<p>'I saw Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> with several friends going about a great deal the worse for liquor.' This was a feeler put by Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> to Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> who judging by the way for him. absence of her husband thought and rightly too, that he wanted her to prepare </p>

<p>‘They were all on the spree the whole day yesterday,' replied Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. 'Mr Cookson invited them all to dinner the previous night and kept it up to a late hour. Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> did not come home till one o'clock this morning. Between 8 and 9 o'clock this morning before he had scarcely rested Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his brother Bonsoe Coomah called over to take 'a refresher,' as they called it, with him; and they continued at it for some time before they left. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had just finished breakfast and as the steamer was expected he was busy writing his business letters when all the friends that were invited to Mr <span class="personal-name-21">Cockson</span>’s dinner came in and spent a good portion of the day with him, of course drinking. There was no staying at home for him after that and they all went out together. He came home late in the night “screwed”21 and it is no wonder that you did not see him when you came in. He went to bed immediately after breakfast I must not stay out long as he may probably want me when he wakes up.’ </p> 

<p>‘Your husband - I beg your pardon, for Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> is not legally your husband until you are married by a minister; ‘Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,’ continued Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, was nor so when 1 first knew him shortly after he had returned from <span Class-"place-name-3">England</span>. He was a class member then, used not to drink and was esteemed by all the members of the society. My husband was very fond of him. It is sad that he should Keep such company ana scatter away his precious time. Why don’t you speak to him about it. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> says that he has several times pointed out to him the necessity of his joining the society, which is the only source of happiness but he has failed and has given up any further attempt.’</p> 

<p>‘I can assure you dear Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>’ replied she ‘that I regret exceedingly the life my husband is now leading. In —’ </p> 

<p>‘Your husband! ’ interrupted the minister’s wife most indignantly. ‘Did I not tell you a short time ago that he is not your husband? Have I not told you often. . and my husband the same, that native marriages are not marriages in a legal I sense? If custom has established them, does not common sense teach us to Know the utter absurdity of them? Marriage where the contracting parties, the man as well as the woman, have power to dissolve it at will is in the estimation of the church no marriage at all. Do you not know that Mr <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> can send you away tomorrow it he likes, or you can go away from him? I know that there is the most intense love subsisting between you; why does he not take you to church at once? The very fact of his not having done so, altho’ you have lived together more than 8 years, shows some intention on his part to send you adrift as soon as he finds one who would suit him better. I would advise you therefore as a friend and as one who has got your interests at hear to make a stand and show him by your future conduct that he must decide between you and any one he may chance to choose. He would not be a member, and you are not; if you were, God should Grant you such grace and strength that in the course of time this design could be accomplished. You should —’  </p>

<p>‘Enough,’ cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> interrupting her, and bewildered. She was grieved and at the same time annoyed, partly with herself and partly with her companion, for taking such liberties with, and talking in such a high tone to her and she to be quiet. Nobody else but a minister’s wife could presume to talk to her in this manner with impunity. ‘Enough’, she cried; I did not think that you were going to take me over to your house to insult me, for insult I take your words to be; and but for the extreme respect I have for you this would be the last time you, ever see me in your house. For several years 1 have lived with this man and I never experienced an unkind word, any ill-treatment or the least sign of a wish to break off the connection between us and above all I have never seen any difference between his conduct towards me, either private or public and other men’s conduct towards their wives althogh married according to the church. I am satisfied with him living as we are, and I am sure he will never think of sending me away so long as 1 conduct myself in the same way as I have hitherto done towards him. I do not, however, wish it to be understood that I am satisfied with my husband’s late unseemly conduct; but that is a fault not to be attributed to the nature of our marriage; and I sincerely wish I could find some means of bringing about some reformation in him.’  </p>

<p>For some minutes there was a lull in their conversation, after this sudden exhibition of spirit which had hitherto lain dormant in Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> was too greatly taken aback at the manner in which Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> took her up to sustain her part of the conversation. True they had known each other for some time but she never for a moment thought that Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> would presume to talk like that to her on any occasion.  </p>

<p>Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> did not lose a word of what passed between the two ladies, and at this stage, he thought it was high time to join them. He accosted Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> in a most complacent manner; in which spirit she also returned the compliment. Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> thought when he joined the ladies that there was no chance for him to succeed in his disinterested work of converting Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, through whom he thought he could get at Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu </span> upon whose conversion he had principally set his heart.  </p>

<h2><p>CHAPTER V  </p></h2>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 10th April 1886</p></h4>  

<p>‘I have been rather busy in my study,’ began he when he joined them, up a sermon for Sunday, a most insinuating air, ‘I ‘getting By the bye,’ continued he, at the same time assuming am glad to see that you go to chapel occasionally, and to observe that you are a good and attentive listener. I have observed you often whilst preaching, and it did my heart good to see you so piously bent. May I ask, were you in the habit of going to chapel before you came to this place? I should like very much to know that.’</p>  

<p>‘Very seldom Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,’ she replied. I had no wish.’ ‘That augurs well since now your attendance here is more frequent. Do you find the sermons interesting?’</p>  

<p>‘Yes, some of them, not all,’ she replied, smiling.  </p>

<p>‘That’s right; but do you find any difference between the speeches (sermons) made in chapel and the speeches made at any other place? You under- stand what I mean of course?’ </p>

<p> ‘Yes the difference is vast. I always fee1 glad and happy when I hear the word of God preached, and when it is talked about. There is something in it that I am unable to express.’ 

 <p>‘Would you not join the people of God then, when such are your feelings when you hear his word preached?’ demanded Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, his countenance radiant with smiles. </p>

 <p>‘Certainly I would; but who do you mean are the people of God? are not all the people that go to chapel God’s people?’</p> 

<p> ‘Certainly not. The people of God are those who finding that they are sinners, enter their names as members of the society, and who regularly attend class meetings. Would you not wish to become a class member, and be one of God’s people?’ </p>

 <p>I should like it very much —’  </p>

<p>‘But supposing Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,’ interrupted the Reverend gentleman intentionally, ‘were to tell you not to, what would you do? Would you obey him rather than keeping the promise you have just given me?’ ‘My husband never denies my anything which he considers good for me; and in this one I am sure he will allow me.’ </p> 

<p>‘You do very well to have such confidence in your husband - in Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; but supposing he prevents you?’</p>  

<p>Do not press the point Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>,’ replied Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> somewhat curtly; T I know that he will allow me. It is true that he does not wish to be one himself, but I never heard him speak ill against it.’ </p> 

<p>What he 'When may I hear from you Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?' Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> asked, not feeling alto- so her husband and have given such a promise from which she could not turn and by which he (could hold her. </p>

<p>'As soon as I speak to my husband about it,' she replied. 'Now I must go home,' added she, getting up, 'I have stayed longer than I thought, and I may be wanted now.' </p>

<p>Stay one moment, dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,' besought the Rev gentleman, 'only one moment! It appears to me that there is some coldness between you and my wife which must be made right before you leave. Will you shake hands together and be cordial friends again. That's right. We will now kneel down and ask divine blessing upon our humble endeavours to gain more sheep and bring them into his fold.'</p> 

<p>Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> left as soon as the prayer was over, leaving Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and his wife to deliberate on the probable result of their proceedings. </p>

<p>'You very nearly spoilt the game my dear,' said Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>. 'It was very fortunate that I was listening, and therefore was able to join in at the right moment or we don't know what the result would have been. You women could never be tacticians, What a pity it would have been had we lost her, and, through her Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.' </p>

<p>'It would have been a pity indeed,' replied his better half, 'but whoever thought that under a calm, quiet and placid exterior as she generally manifested, there lurked a spirit - a temper like that. I was really taken aback; and I am afraid, had you not dropped in at the right moment, there would have been a row, as I certainly could not bear such an insult from a person who is merely kept by a man. </p>

<p>I am very glad that I dropped in then,' replied Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> seriously, 'for you would have got the worse of the conflict of words which you women generally delight in. Have you been so long intimate with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, and are ignorant of her natural disposition? Don't talk nonsense my dear, but be thankful that I saved you and the great cause likewise.</p> 

<p>Who talks of nonsense but you Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>?' asked his spouse, her temper getting up. 'You men usually take the part of other women against your own wives, ministers not excepted.' </p>

<p>'And you ladies generally take the part of other men against your own husbands, ministers' wives not excepted,' returned Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>. 'Would you despise your hand because you have inadvertently plunged it into something loathsome? Would you not rather wash it clean in lavender water and bring it to its former state? Well, is it because one woman, who is as much a creature of God as you are, happened not to be married according to Church rites that she is to be despised by other women because they are so married? Should we not rather persuade her to enter into Church marriage and thereby save her soul? If you don't despise your hand, because it has touched an unclean thing, why should you despise a woman because she happened to live in a state of concubinage? Is that a spirit of charity? Don’t let me hear any more of such unchristian expressions from you again; and I hope you will assist me in my endeavours to convert these two precious souls, by continuing on the same terms of friendship with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>.’ </p>

 

<h4><p>Western Echo, 24th April 1886 </p></h4> 

<p>After this wholesome admonition from her husband Mrs <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> kept quiet for some time with her head bent down seemingly in deep cogitation; she then went to her bedroom where we will leave her to ponder over her husband’s words. </p> 

 

<h2><p>CHAPTER VI</p> </h2> 

<h3><p>REVD, <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> AND <span class="personal-name">QUAIBU</span>  </p></h3>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 24th April 1886 (continued) </p></h4>

<p> A few months subsequent to the proceedings related in the chapter immediately following [read: preceding, SN] this; and after Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had been fairly admitted a member on trial in the. Wesleyan body for she could not be admitted into full membership since she was living, as was considered, in a state of concubinage, the Revd. <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> called to see Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, and demanded to have some talk with him in private. This being granted the missionary commenced:</p> 

<p>‘You really must excuse the liberty I am going to take with you. Don’t be offended at what I am going to say to you; but consider it as a word prompted by a spirit of friendship, and an ardent desire for your real happiness.’</p> 

<p> ‘Since I parge to this country, and became acquainted with you I have found in you all that one could desire or expect from or in a friend. You have doubtless found in my frequent visits to you more than to any body else, in the many rides and walks we have had together; and in the pleasure I always take in your company, that I hold you in great esteem. But there is one thing wanting to make our friendship more complete. As a missionary and a preacher of the Gospel, one whose business out here is to convert souls, I would be wanting in my duty were I not to speak to you on your spiritual concerns. It is true, and I am glad to say, that your attendance in chapel on Sundays is very regular; that speaks well for you. If you had been a professed Christian instead of nominal one you could not have paid more attention to the words that fall from the mouth of the preacher. I have watched you often whilst preaching. If therefore you could cast in your lot among us and become a professed Christian I shall be happy indeed and I need not say I shall be happier in your company.’ </p>

<p> ‘Being a professed Christian, I suppose you mean becoming a class member,’ inquired Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.</p>  

<p>‘Certainly’ replied <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>. ‘And what could prevent you from being one? I have been told by Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>, with whom I have on several occasions spoken about you that you have a strong antipathy to class meetings. </p>

 <p>‘Your colleague is right in telling you so, dear <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>,’ replied Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. ‘As an individual I do not think it serves me a bit in my aspirations to act according to the dictates of conscience. Often have I done violence to the secret whisperings of that “little insect in my head,” conscience, and have become a class member and as often broken my resolutions to be one. Mr </p> 

<p><span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> himself can tell you this. It is experience and not ignorance of the thing that makes me somewhat shy. I am afraid you will not find it an easy task to induce me to become one. </p>

<p>'What is your real objection, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>? tell me; I may probably find some arguments in its favour to make it all right; for I am determined on having you Nolens, Volens." </p>

<p>'Am I to understand that I am to speak freely, unconstrainedly, without giving offence by any words that I may have occasion to use, Hardy?' asked Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

<p>'Of course you can say anything you like, barring indecent words or unchristian expressions,' replied the minister. </p>

<p>"There is no fear of that dear Hardy. I have too great a respect for myself to be guilty of such ill-breeding. As an institution among many that the great founder of the sect - Mr Wesley-brought about,' continued <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, class meeting deserves to be ranked among the best; but it, like many schemes originally established with the best of intentions has been frightfully abused. Now as to the objections - and there are many - that I have against it. First, I really can not find it in my conscience to confess my sins to a man who is by nature as frail and as sinful as myself; and to confess them too before several other persons. For instance, I am required at the meeting to tell my feelings and experience during the week. Well, suppose during the week I committed adultery; rabbed a neighbour of a very valuable property; or accused a man, whom I hated, of a crime of which he was innocent, whereby his good character or reputation was ruined. Who, but a mad man would go to the meeting, before a whole lot of people and tell his leader at their hearing the feelings which prompted him during the week to commit such crimes; and with the knowledge too that some of the parties present might be a friend, a relative, or the very party or parties against whom the crime was committed? Is it not beyond the pale of human nature to do so? My dear friend if you can prove to me and to my satisfaction that this is possible and that it is within those things which a human being can accomplish I must submit even if it is against my conviction. </p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 8th May 1886 </p></h4>

<p>‘That, what you have been describing is against human nature I must agree with you' remarked <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>; 'and therefore it is that members are not required to confess the sins or crimes they may have committed during the week. That would be preposterous. </p>

<p>'What then are they required to do at the meeting' demanded <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>? </p>

<p>"They have only to tell what God has done for them during the week, the temptations to which they have been subjected; praying to God to give them Jesus. grace and strength to resist the devil and to increase their faith in the Lord Jesus. ‘If this is the sole object of the meeting, I must acknowledge that I have nothing to say against it,’ replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; ‘but I cannot help observing as I mentioned before, that the scheme has been frightfully abused. I have heard class members who at the meeting confess, nay, boast that their sins were forgiven; and say that if they died, there and then, they would go to heaven. Yet I have seen many turn out the poor and the needy from their doors; cheat the widow and the orphan out of their inheritance; many who would not assist an unfortunate but worthy man, to recover himself, because if they did, they would be helping him to raise himself to an independent position which they hate; who would run down and severely backbite their neighbour because they envy him; who w’ld pretend sincere friendship towards a fellow whilst they secretly hate him, and would do him an injury if they could. Have I not seen them seduce other people’s wives? Oh God! can a pious institution like this be made the instrument of such wickedness’ exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, not a little excited. Seeing that the minister was quiet and not immediately inclined to speak, he continued, ‘can you wonder that knowing all these, I should shew such great disinclination to join that meeting or be a member thereof? would it not be by far better for me to confess any sin or crime that I commit to my minister, who like a doctor, and a gentleman is bound to my secret and who could know the nature of my disease - the crime or sin committed - be able to give me wholesome advice, and pray with or for me; than going to class meetings and there saying that I am what I am not; have done that which I have never done, or ever thought of doing; and adding sin to sin, thus aggravating the commission of one sin, where other persons - say even the heathens - only commit it once. A man commits an unworthy act; that act is a sin against God for which he can repent and ask Him to forgive him. But instead of that he goes to the meeting, and either tells his leader that he is a sinner, which he has no occasion to do since by nature we are all sinners or on the other hand, brags that he stands square with God and has made his election sure. Does he not aggravate the one sin that he has committed by deceiving God, his leader, his fellow members and him- self, besides the lies that he tells or the cloak that he puts on by general confession of his sinful nature for which there is no necessity? This is the honest confession of my feelings against class meetings generally. If after this you still wish me to join it, and you shew me how, I shall be only too glad and happy to submit to your advice.’  </p>

<p>I must say that when a man wilfully sets his heart against anything, however good and unexceptionable that thing may be, it were easier to remove the mountain than convince him,’ replied <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span>. ‘However I am still bent on having you amongst us and will therefore do this with you. At the meetings you will not be asked to tell your feelings unless you particularly wish to do so yourself; and at any time you wish to tell me anything that troubles your mind or are desirous of having a religious talk with me I shall only be too glad to accord to the chance. Will this satisfy you? I do not think you will have anything to say against this.’ </p>

<p>‘Perfectly,’ answered Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‘and you may consider me now as a member of the society.’ </p> 

<p>A little time after this as the two friends were talking about other matters I which need no record here. Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> passed. She was told by the Rev. gentleman of what had taken place and that she might consider her man as one of them; upon which she expressed her thankfulness and left. Before <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> left he told Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> that the next important subject that he would talk to him about would be in reference to Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; that he knew that was a delicate matter; but as Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> had told him that the lady would not be averse to her being married to him in the church provided he also would like it and considering that he was now a member of this (ministers’) class, he would have some talk with him on the subject D.V.22 to-morrow. The friends then separated, <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> being satisfied with himself for having succeeded in gaining over Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to join the Society. As for Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> himself it could not be made out whether he was pleased or not with the rash promise he had given, for he sat down for sometime cogitating deeply. He however got up afterwards and went to his wife’s apartment where he found her busy dressing her hair. </p>

 <h2><p>CHAPTER VII </p></h2> 

<h3><p><span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> AND MISS <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> </p></h3> 

<h4><p>Western Echo, 21st May 1886</p></h4> 

<p> We recorded at the conclusion of the last chapter that Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> went to his wife’s apartment after the minister had left and that he met her adjusting her hair. He waited until she had finished, then got her to dismiss the girl who had been assisting her with her hair, and in a most lively and interesting manner opened up a conversation.</p>  

<p>‘My dear girl, you really must be uncommonly pleased with me to-day. Now tell the truth.’ ‘Why should I be satisfied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> and with —’</p>  

<p>‘Stop a bit’ he interrupted laughing, ‘and with yourself too prodigiously?’ </p> 

<p>‘How and why? you most wicked man,’ demanded Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. ‘Curb your impatience a little, Madame,’ continued he tauntingly; ‘you will know it in due course of time. You are not only pleased with me and yourself, but I can see that you are moreover pleased with and thankful iu the minister for what he has done to-day.’</p>  

<p>‘What has he done? and why should I be pleased with it? don’t be foolish,’ cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. ‘If you have got anything to tell me be quick about it, for I have got no time to waste upon such a naughty man like you.’ Whilst talking she was all the time looking at his face to ascertain whether he was joking with her or was in real earnest. </p> 

<p>‘You women are strange; your contradictions and denials are admissions and affirmations; your yes’s are no’s. Why, my good lady, I could see plainly in your countenance these words written in prominent characters - “The good minister has achieved a most praiseworthy act for which I must thank him. If it was not indelicate for a lady to kiss a gentleman, half a dozen kisses from me would not be enough, but I will make such a nice cake for him - and I know well how to make one - and send it. It will be a modest recognition of his kindness this day.” Now confess that I am right in my conjecture.’ </p> 

<p>‘Cease troubling me with your nonsense, Mr Incorrigible. Now that I think fit, and two persons can play the same game, I will confess this much to you. I heard the minister say that he will come over again tomorrow. I have made up my mind to give him double the number of kisses you say you can read on the forehead of my face; and as many more to Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> for which purpose you found me busy adjusting my hair. I intended then to dress and call over to see him in order to effect this." </p> 

<p>‘A thousand thunders!’ exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, not a little taken back: ‘I would rather see the two worthy ministers further away from the scene! You really could not mean it!' </p>

<p>'Now Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,' continued she, teasingly, 'are not the kisses my own and have I not the right to shower them upon any good man I please? They are not yours; what can you have to say about or against it, you good for nothing man!' You are wrong, my dear girl, terribly wrong! It is true that the kisses are your own; but is it not equally true that I have bought a monopoly over them so far as you are concerned? and that nobody can share with me the gratification thereat? You can not give them away without tearing them one by one from my heart."</p> 

<p>'From your heart; you say this? and do you feel it?' she asked seriously enough 'And yet you did not consider my heart when you showered upon, and literally smothered Miss with the kisses which are mine by monopoly also as you called it yesterday at Mr Fabrah's. Don't you think that women are endued with the same heart and sentiments as men? It was to pay you in your own coins that I was preparing to go Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>'s to thank him with kisses for what he had done and the white minister for what he did yesterday. </p>

<p>'Not too fast, my dear, not too fast,' cried Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, not knowing how to take her words, whether to take them seriously or not. He however denied the charge of having kissed Miss - and ended by asking his wife whether she really meant what she said. </p>

<p>I mean every word I have told you; as also the number of kisses I intend for those two gentlemen. Mean it! Well it was told me by a person who was present when you kissed the young woman.' </p>

<p>And who was the person who told you?' demanded he, perfectly bewildered. </p>

<p>'Not so fast, my dear,' said she exultingly, repeating her husband's words, and then as silently as possible adding, 'tit for tat, my precious boy. You are in an unusually teasing mood to-day, my girl,' he cried. </p>

<p>It is a contagious disease my dear young man,' she replied; 'you see I am more polite than you are. I qualify the word man with the adjective young. </p>

<p>'I am puzzled!' exclaimed the unfortunate man gradually getting heated. 'Have I known you for these long years and never found out the real stuff of which you are composed?' </p>

<p>'Have I also known you for these many years,' she replied, 'without finding out that you are a pitiless teaser?'</p> 

<p>'Now let us do away with these profitless quibbles,' he then exclaimed. Just give me the name of the party from whom you gleaned the information that I was free in another person's company and who told such extraordinary lies about me and whether you him. </p>

<p>'Not until you pay for the information' she answered, pitilessly interrupting </p>

<p>'And whether you really mean to go out, and to Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>'s too, with the intention of — well you know what I mean,' continued the man in his anxiety to know her real feelings, and disregarding her demand for payment of the information.</p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 31st May 1886 </p> </h4>

<p>‘Let it out man, let out the word,' she said in a taunting manner, then added, ‘Yes I meant to kiss him, but now I wont do so if  you will pay me for it.’ </p>

<p>‘And the white person?’ continued he without taking notice of what his wife had said.  </p>

<p>‘Him I will certainly kiss with double the number of kisses unless you pay me well for that also!’ </p>

<p> ‘Must I pay yea for the simple information, and for preventing you from doing that which it is base for a respectable woman to do? You really are to-day much disposed to make money, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>!’</p>  

<p>‘Who said that I wanted money,’ interrupted the lady; ‘and your money too! as if I did not consider that what you have got is mine and mine yours. ’</p> 

 <p>‘But what is it you want? I would rather satisfy you than to continue this fruitless pass of words,’ humbly gave in Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.  </p>

<p>‘Fruitless indeed! Acknowledge now honestly that you have had the worse of it, and that in future you will respect my sex, however illiterate I may be, and treat me better than you have treated me to-day. Women’s denials and contradictions, their affirmations, indeed! as if men are the only creatures that were made to tell exactly what they mean or feel. ’</p>  

<p>‘By the <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>! I have caught a Tartar to-day and no mistake! Well I shall now give in; tell me 'the name of your informant! ’ </p> 

<p>‘Well I also will give in,’ she said, repeating her husband’s very words. ‘I shall have pity on you. Now tell me what it was that <span class="personal-name-23">Mr Hardy</span> told you which has brought on your poor head the nest of hornets?’ </p> 

<p>‘I have promised to be a member of his class; he told you so himself. Are you not glad my <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>?’ </p> 

<p>I? No! Why should 1 be glad? You are rather wrong if you thought so. “The soul that sinneth it shall die.”231 have my own soul to think or take care of, my dear husband. I do not see why I should be so uncommonly glad.’ </p> 

<p>‘How unfeelingly you do talk to-day, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,’ replied poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, quite beside himself. I really thought you would rejoice at it, and so came in to have a chat with you about it and about another matter which he told me. But I see now that you never cared for me,’ said he getting up to go away.  </p>

<p>Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> seeing her husband in the miserable plight she had put him into, got up hastily and encircled her plump arms round his neck and gave him the kisses which she intended for the two persons, but which she really never intended to give them, and submissively begged him to forgive her. Mr <span class="personal-name">Mr Quaibu</span> reseated himself and was restored to the spirits in which he first went to his wife’s apartment, by her telling him that she merely assumed that attitude to punish him for daring to tease her, and treating her in a manner he never did before. </p> 

<p>‘Then I must not believe a single word of what you said,’ said Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> quite himself again. ‘No Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,’ she answered, feeling really proud of her success in teasing her liege Lord and bringing him to her feet.</p>	 

<p>‘Nor, my having kissed the young woman too?’ again asked he.  </p>

 <p>‘That also has no existence but in my brains,’ she replied.  </p>

<p>And the kisses to the persons?’ he again asked looking keenly at her. </p> 

<p>‘Fie! Did you really believe that I was really capable of committing such an unwomanly act? That shows me how very lightly you think of me and how very low you consider my morals to be. However let us forget what has passed and talk about the interesting subject which, I do not deny now, does occupy my mind, and at which I cannot help rejoicing. When I was a member and you were not, I felt, as it were, that we were separated by a deep chasm but now that you have become one, that wicked barrier is removed-and we are close to each other again.’ </p>

<p> I see that you are yourself again, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,’ returned her husband; ‘and as you know that I do not wish to be in debt I will pay you back the kisses you gave me.’</p> 

 <p>‘Have done, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>,’ cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. releasing herself at the same time from her spouse. ‘If you go on at this rate you will not have any more left with me to pay you for the other information you promised to give me.’ </p> 

<p>‘What information did I promise you, my dear?’ asked he. ‘I certainly do not recollect it. ’ ‘Do you wish to travel upon the same road again, my dear <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>? Have you so soon forgotten how grievously you missed your way? and but for me you would be still wandering, wandering until you got benighted?’</p>  

<p>‘Honor bright, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>; I certainly do not recollect giving you promise of any information,’ replied he. </p> 

<p>‘Nor do you know anything else besides joining the society, which you and the minister talked about to-day?’	</p> 

<p> ‘I see it now, by the <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>! Ah! you women as you sat here whilst the minister and myself were in the hall talking, of course you could not hear a word of what we were talking about. Could, you <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>? Well, there is <span <span class="personal-name-3"><span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span></span> and Miss Butah your friend sitting down in the hall talking and I can hear every word they utter, although they are not talking loud. Now acknowledge that you heard it whilst we were talking and that you did not hear it from me. </p>

<p> Acknowledge this and as soon as our visitors are gone we will have a quiet  “confab” about it, and I will tell you also my views on the matter, which will place you in a position to judge.’ </p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 16th June 1886</p></h4>  

<p>‘I shall give in <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; but I sincerely wish your friend Mr<span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his wife will not stay long so that we may resume our conversation. I am so impatient to know all about it.’</p> 

<p> They joined Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> and his companion who seemed on the pins to get away as the sun was getting too hot she said, and they had a long way to go. Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> was not a little pleased, but had the good grace to press her companion to wait until the cool of the evening. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> however for obvious reasons was so pressing on Mr <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> that he at last consented to wait. He had to go to Nouveau Vue on a little business with the judge, but Mrs<span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> (no 5) had to go a long way as she was going to Eksbury.</p>

 <p>What is the news of the day?’ enquired <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> of his friend. </p> 

<p>‘There is no particular news that I am aware of,’ he at first answered, but subsequently added, ‘by the bye, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, have you received any note from <span class="personal-name-12">Mr Cleighmore</span>? I went over to see him this morning on business, and whilst there I saw a lot of notes addressed to a few friends. I took mine and found it an invitation to dinner at his house tomorrow evening.’</p> 

<p> ‘Another dinner party! exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> rather sorrowful. ‘These repeated dinner parties don’t agree with me. I wish I could discover a plausible excuse with a view to be absent.’ </p>

<p> ‘What is up old fellow?’ demanded his friend. ‘Do you wish to withdraw from our clique? You will have a tough job to accomplish, I can assure you.’  </p>

<p>‘Oh no, that was not my intention when I said that. But you must acknowledge that we had really too much of it lately, and I was never accustomed to such a dissipated course before I came here.’ </p>

 <p>‘Be off 'with you,’ exclaimed <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. ‘To talk of dissipation. Is there any place more “dissipated” than your <span class="place-name-cape-coast"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast" target="_blank">Cape Coast</a></span>?</p>  

<p>‘<span Class-"place-name-1">Dobblesie</span> is certainly a “dissipated” town, but it is quite a quiet place when compared to that town of yours. <span Class-"place-name-2">Gangacre</span> is notoriously known to be the jolliest town in our part of the coast; you must acknowledge that, <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. </p>

 <p>‘There is a letter for you and another for my master Edward,’ interrupted <span class="personal-name-30">Aghastone</span> the head servant of Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, who handed the letters and with- drew. The very identical note of invitation from Cleighmore' exclaimed <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; 'What a good job it is, it is for to-morrow. I have time to turn it over in my head whether I shall go or not.'</p> 

<p>'But you must go <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, or we will know the reason why' exclaimed <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. 'We don't do things by halves here as you of <span Class-"place-name-1"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Coast"</a>Dobblesie</span>. What a nuisance!' he exclaimed after glancing at his letter. 'I suppose I must go after all, and to the very place I was trying to avoid in this hot time. The judge wish- es to see me at once at his residence.' </p>

<p>'Wont you take something cooling <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> before you leave?' asked <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

<p>'No' thanks. I must keep a clear head before His Honor. I don't know what tough matter he is going to speak to me about, and I have not forgotten the wet- ting you gave me. </p>

<p>'Good bye then for the present. Are you also going?' addressing himself to Mrs <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>. 'Can't your friend persuade you to stay until the cool of the evening?' </p>

<p>'I have done all I could,' put in Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, 'to induce her to stay, but go she must, she says. She promises to come over to-morrow evening to spend the time with me whilst you are away. </p>

<p>'Whilst I am away! where to?' asked <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. </p>

<p>'Read that note in your hands again,' replied <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. </p>

<p>'Oh I have forgotten. But you seem to be very anxious for me to go to the dinner, Miss. Well good bye Mrs <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>; I hope to see you again to-mor- row evening??</p> 

<p>'You will not see her then, for you wont be at home,' insisted Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. 'What a curious girl you are!' <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could only say. </p>

<p>As soon as the <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span>s left Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> insisted upon resuming their private talk, and to have it over, so to the old place they went. It certainly must be confessed that do whatever he would poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could not make himself out, much less Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. The lady had shown a change, or decided to change since she became a class member; and may not the contemplated Church marriage effect greater changes in her against his peace of mind? As man he thought if he did not assume his right position at the eve of the bond soon to be contracted between himself and her, he might as well cast his authority to the winds after the celebration of the marriage, and submit himself to be hen-pecked for life. He thought better therefore to make a resolute stand and refuse to discuss the subject until he thought fit and proper to do so. On the other hand he thought that if he refused to have it out then his chance of doing so before the promised interview with the minister on the next day would be lost and without having the talk over with her so as by it a result to know whether or not he would be studying his and her future happiness by consenting to the project, he would be leaping in the dark and plunging her and himself into life-long misery. He therefore chose the least of the two evils and quietly submitted with good grace to the discussion of their second marriage. Poor man! He was in a sad predicament. To have the talk there and then he would be giving in to his wife which he did not wish to do; and not to do so, he either must give the minister his promise to marry in the Church in which case he would be acting blindly in the affair or if he refused he felt that he must give him - the minister - good and sufficient reasons for refusing which he could not do without first having an interview with her. The lady therefore carried the day, and nothing loathe opened the ball by asking <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> to tell her what the minister told him.</p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 30th June 1886 </p></h4> 

<p>'Are you indeed very anxious to know it? 'he asked, cautiously approaching the subject.</p>  

<p>‘How provoking you are now <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; you know very well that I am very anxious; what is the use of asking?’ </p> 

<p>‘To come again to the point <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. He showed me a superb ring which was said was a present from Her Majesty the Queen to her beloved subject, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, of whom she had heard a great deal, and the <span class="personal-name-knight"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight" target="_blank">Knight</a></span>hood to her subject, even your beloved husband, on condition that we perform a certain meritorious deed which he the minister mentioned.’</p>  

<p>‘Although I find that you are joking with me, and that you would learn no lesson by what took place at our last interview, yet as I am really anxious to know what it was I will condescend to ask you what the conditions were by the performance of which I would be entitled to the ring, and you to the title of knighthood. ’ </p>

<p> I am not joking, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. I have told you exactly what he said. However if you don’t comprehend it I will be more explicit. The mystic ring is the emblem of marriage. I am to have the custody thereof for the present, until the time come when I shall have to give it to you in chapel, before the ordained minister and witnesses. The order of knighthood is an honourable title conferred upon nobody else but those who are of good reputation, high respectability and of good position. The fact of this title being conferred upon me does not only shew that I have hitherto been worthy of it but through our future life I must maintain its respectability by which alone I shall be considered by all classes of men as a respectable member of society This is the idea of Christians. Now, as women generally share the dignity of their husbands, so they also become F highly respectable as soon as ever the ring is transferred from the husband to the wife, and it is their bounden duty to help the man to keep it always respectable, and without whom it is utterly impossible. You may ask, how is it that the Queen of <span Class-"place-name-3">England</span> has to do with marriages generally? Know that she is the head of the Protestant faith, represents God on earth, her name is only mentioned in this light; but as I am a creature of God who has made me What 1 am by implanting in me an earnest desire to acquire a position of worth and respectability among Christian communities in particular, and in this world generally, I consider that what I am and what I have, including the ring and the order or knighthood (emblem of respectability) are as it were presents from him and him only through his vicar on earth which is the Queen, Defender of the Faith. Are you satisfied that I was not joking? and do you understand now what it was that the minister was asking me?’ </p>

<p> ‘I understand you perfectly; but I must say, however, that I do not fully comprehend the part Her Majesty has to do in the matter. I do not think that you do understand yourself, although you have been trying hard to make the best of it. I am, however, satisfied there is an end of it. By the by, Bonsoe Kumah, do you intend going to <span class="personal-name-12">Mr Cleighmore</span>’s dinner?’ </p> 

<p>‘Away with dinners,’ cried <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> surprised. ‘Is it possible that you are ignorant of the seriousness of the matter into which we are plunging? I see by the light way you take it that your friend, the minister, and his wife have only shewn you its bright and pleasant side; and have kept from you either intentionally or not, its dark, hideous and most miserable side. I will not allow you to undertake an affair of such a nature with your eyes shut, and I will endeavour to explain it to you in the best way I can, leaving you to decide or take what course you please. </p> 

<p>‘I cannot give you an elaborate elucidation of the thing, as I am not clever 1 enough to do so; but whatever I know about it I will endeavour to explain to N you so that you may be in a position to decide whether we are not happier as we are in our native marriage than we would be in the Church one.</p>  

<p>‘We are going to stand before God, and each of us is to take a solemn Oath in the presence of the minister who is to marry us, and before witnesses. I have to swear, on my part, that I will keep you and you only as my legal wife, and that I will never take or keep another woman besides yourself as long as I live. I have to swear further, that I will support and protect you in sickness and everything in which by nature, women are specially weak to and respect you as well as I do myself and to cause others to respect you by my own conduct and behaviour towards you. As far as I am concerned I shall find the new state very easy enough; in fact I can see no difference between the way I have hitherto treated you and that which I shall be enjoined by the new tie. The only difference I can see is, as we are now situated you can leave me at any time. And I can send you away also at any time. This embraces the principle if not the entire duty towards you as a husband. You on your part will have to swear that you will honour, love and obey me in all lawful commands, and that you will respect me above all men excepting perhaps your father. This you will find easy enough to do since you have practised it during the 8 years of our connection. If this was all we would have nothing whatsoever to fear, and can have no apprehension as to the wreck of our mutual happiness. What we have now to be very anxious about and of which 1 have the great dread is the substitution o/ that with has hitherto proved efficacious in keeping us to our duty towards each other, for that which may not equally prove powerful enough to produce the same effect. That which has hitherto kept us together is our having been left alone to act as we choose or in other words, the liberty we have of ridding our- selves of each other at any time we mind to. This may seem strange not only to you but to a great many persons who may not have had serious thought about the matter; but it is nevertheless true according to my own individual convictions. The free-will implanted in us by God to act as we think proper, would be fraught with evil, in fact act banefully in our marriage life had it not been something else which is extremely strong in its nature to keep it within bound. For instance in our case. From the time that we lived as man and wife up to the present time, it is little more than eight years; during all this time option has been granted to either of us to live as we commenced, or to separate. I have elected' to have you always with me, and have felt that if you leave me I shall feel very miserable. What must I do to have you always to live with me? It is nothing more or less than to love and cherish you, to treat you kindly and with the utmost consideration, to anticipate your very wants, and, in every way to treat you with the greatest respect and affection. If I did not behave in such a manner towards you could you have lived so long with me? Never. It is against human nature. Well, it is because I stand a chance of losing you therefore it is that I have been constrained to show you all these considerations; and I am sure if father, mother or any other persons, or influences were to rise up to break the connection between us, as we are now situated, you would not listen to them. You would rather, I am sure /eave your father and mother, and cleave unto me, for you have become bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh (Gen. Chap II verse 23-4). This is the real marriage, the grand DIVINE UNION - marriage - ordained by God, between a man and a woman. It is pure, unalloyed, and free from the contamination of all extraneous influences. On your part, it is just the same. If you did not show me all what I have already enumerated, if you did not behave towards me in a way in which a wife ought to behave towards her husband, we should have separated long ago. As in my case so have you been afraid of the power that I have of sending you away. This is the whole principle of country marriage, as far as monogamy goes, and I would, not give it up in exchange for another if I can help myself. But it may be asked what about the liberty that the man has" of taking unto himself more than one wife? The answer is simple; a man of religious principles and a gentleman who really and truly respects himself would rather have but one wife, provided that that wife is all that he desires in her, than to have more than one, which would be a source of discomfort and misery in his house.</p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 14th July 1886 </p></h4> 

<p>‘You have seen, <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, the liberty, the freedom of action, enjoyed in country marriages. I will tell you now that for which we are going to sacrifice what has heretofore been a source of happiness and bliss to us.' ‘Liberty is sweet, and natural laws are stronger than laws that any civil power can inaugurate. The marriage I have just described to you is full of liberty, because it is nature's institution or something near it; whilst free will or liberty has no place in the one I am going to describe to you; because it is a civil institution opposed to nature. It is this: we swear before God and man that nothing but adultery committed by one or both of us could dissever the connection between us; otherwise we must live together through life whether or not I treat you kindly. In this one, the oath that we take to bind us together - a very sharp instrument for people living as we are, to handle - takes the place of liberty and free will or action of the other. In the country marriage the love is fed continually by the FEAR that at the least ill-treatment your wife or your husband might leave you, and marry another; in the church marriage there is no such incentive manages with us there. Whilst in the one (native marriage) we have every reason to be careful how we act, in the other, license is given to us to do whatever we like. The woman is at liberty to say "I can do whatever I like now, so long as my husband can not of his own wish and inclination divorce me unless he can prove adultery against me. Now love may go to the winds; I will enjoy myself the best way I can" [quotation marks added, SN]. With love, obedience, honor and respect far away the poor miserable dupe of a husband gets his eyes open when it is too late for him to retract. The man may lose the love he had for the wife for the like reasons, although he may show her respect for her own sake, and keep outward appearances. The man, besides other miseries that he has it in his power to inflict upon his wife, cannot help treating her differently from the kind of treatment he gave her before marriage. Then if he showed his true colours his lady love being unshackled could give him his congé; but now that she is enchained, for any act of his towards her barring brutal treatment and adultery, he may not care. In the church marriages, according to the state of our society license is given us to make each other miserable, while in the country one the license given is in the other way. Now <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> you have heard all what I have told you about these two kinds of marriages; I will leave you now to think of it; let me know your decision before the minister makes his intended visit tomorrow.' </p>

<p>I really must thank you,' replied Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, 'for the trouble at which you have been to explain the nature of the two marriages to me. But if church marriage is as bad as you have depicted it, how is it that all white men in their country go by it?'</p> 

<p>You are right to ask me that question,' replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. 'It would take me too long to explain all the reasons to you. Enough if I tell you that whilst it has taken more than a thousand years to make the white men what they are now, we, on our side cannot count even one hundred; so you will easily perceive that their ways so far as the present is concerned are not our ways, neither does that which suit them necessarily suit us. When I speak of church marriages I mean as they concern us in this country. </p>

<p>'But I see many legally married couples who live happily together even in our country; why should not others?' asked Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. 'As for instance who my dear girl?' replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>.</p> 

<p> ‘As for instance, Rev Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span> and his wife, <span class="personal-name-26">Hon Coontarmas</span>, <span class="personal-name-27">Mr Gandor</span> and many others,’ she replied.  </p>

<p>‘Allow me to know more about these gentlemen than yourself, my dear, but you do well to instance the few whom you consider to be the bright side of the picture; and now I will not go beyond our own family to bring out the dark side of your picture. What about your aunt and my daddy? Your aum Jemima and her husband; your uncle <span class="personal-name-28">Quantamak</span> and his wife; your uncle <span class="personal-name-29">Mensah</span> and —’  </p>

<p>‘Enough!’ cried Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> suddenly, looking quite bewildered. ‘These are really sad instances you have named. To tell you the real truth you have thoroughly convinced me. But what am I to do? I have not only consented but 1iave also promised to use my influence, if I had any with you, to get you to join the class meetings, and the consummation of this second marriage.  </p>

<p>‘Enough <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>. If you are still willing after the explanation of the two kinds of marriages I have given you, to change the one for the other, I have nothing more to say. I am satisfied if you are. May God help us,’ replied Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> sorrowfully. </p>

 

<h4><p>Western Echo, 14th July 1886 (continued)  </p></h4>

<p>At the meeting that took place between the minister and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> the next day, at which marriage formed the principal topic of conversation, I mean discussion, our hero not being inclined to give up the happiness which he enjoyed in his country marriage state without at least showing to the minister his opinion of the two kinds of marriages, used more forcible arguments than he used when he was with his wife. Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> on his side used all the arguments he could in favour of church or Christian marriage; but he found that he might as well try to convince him that black was white. Finding however that he was going to lose <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, since it was obvious to him that he could not admit him as a class member until he consummated his marriage in the church, Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> said: </p> 

<p>‘By the arguments you have urged forward in favour of country marriage a good portion of which I cannot help admitting to be convincing, I infer that you mean to live as you are with your lady. If such be the case, what about the promise you gave me yesterday of becoming a member of our Society? For you really, as you must be aware, cannot be admitted whilst you live with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> in a state of concubinage - pardon the expression. ’</p>  

<p>‘Dear Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>’ returned <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, ‘you must not consider me capable of giving a promise to day and breaking it tomorrow. Do not infer by the nature of my arguments that I have decided either the one or the other way. Custom or rather habit is second nature, and you cannot expect me to give up at once and without regret the marriage in which I have found such an unalloyed happiness during so many years, for one the consequences, or rather the operations of which, I really cannot tell. You say that 1 cannot be admitted as a member unless I conform to the rites of Christian marriage.’ </p> 

<p>‘That is the rule of the Society; of course you are aware of that,’ replied Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>. 

<p> ‘Even in spite of my having lived for so many years with Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>, sticking to her only, having conferred upon her all the respects that any church married woman can expect; a prey to no jealousies and heart burnings; one who has been able to command even your respect, strict methodist as you are? Even in spite of al! these which are no less than what could be expected in church marriages I must not be admitted into your society?’ </p> 

<p>‘Even so,’ the Rev gentleman replied.  </p>

<p>‘Am I then to understand’ continued <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, that the master is more liberal than his disciples in the line of conduct he prescribed for them to pursue?’ </p> 

<p>‘In what do you charge us with bigotry my dear fellow? wherein would our  </p>

<p>blessed Saviour be liberal and we not have been? warmly. </p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 29th July 1886</p></h4> 

<p>'In the very subject which forms the principal topic of our conversation,' replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. 'Our Lord Jesus, although a God, yet conformed himself to the things of this world when he became incarnate. He would suit his divine precept and teachings to the condition of the people. Did he not command his disciples "to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's and unto God the things that are God's"?" Did he not rebuke the Pharisees for charging his disciples with breach of the Sabbath and uphold his disciples? The Pharisees were astonished when he said the "Sabbath was made for man, but not man for the Sabbath." He knew that his disciples were hungry and therefore considered that it was no sin to pluck the ears of corn on a sabbath day to satisfy the cravings of nature. Certain it is that he would have blamed them and upheld the conduct of the Pharisees had the disciples no hunger to satisfy, but only committed the act through wantonness and on the Sabbath too. He —</p> 

<p>'But my dear fellow,' interrupted Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>, 'what has all this to do with the subject on hand?' </p>

<p>'Great deal sir,' replied he. 'I was going to say when you interrupted me that He, that is our Lord Jesus, would in this instance say, as in the case of the sabbath, that marriage was made for man and not man for marriage.</p> 

<p>'How do you make this out? Where is the analogy? You are handling a subject you don't understand sir,' cried the parson very much excited. </p>

<p>'Quietly, my dear friend,' replied <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, 'quietly. Kindly hear me out and you can decide whether or not I understand the subject.' He then continued. 'I said that Christ would in this case have laid down the precept that 'marriage was made for man, and not man for marriage.' The analogy between the two is obvious. In the case of the disciples HUNGER was the reason of their being right in breaking the Sabbath to satisfy it. It was much better that, than for his disciples to suffer the inconvenience of hunger. Well, in the case of marriage you cannot deny that happiness is the chief end of it (marriage). Our Saviour would have seen that, since happiness would not result in christian marriages among half-barbarous people, pure monogamy, without the oath, would have been a happy substitute; he would have told the Pharisees that marriage was made for man instead of the man being made for it. It does not serve my purpose to enter fully into this part of the subject at present; I will leave it and then enter into the principal topic of our conversation. </p>

<p>'You tell me that I cannot be admitted into your society because the relation between me and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> is an obstacle in the way. To be admitted I must either marry her according to the Church or send her away in order to entitle myself to membership. To send her away, I find is impossible, in fact it would be wicked; it is not to be thought of; and to take her to Church I find I cannot: because we are not ripe enough for such a ceremony; the nature of our society would not admit of it yet I have assured you that if the object of the English . marriage be to ensure happiness, I am satisfied that peace and joy are sufficiently ensured by our country marriages too, however ridiculous they may appear in the eyes of the stranger, and that by forcing people into this kind of marriage, it would be placing a sharp instrument in the hands of ignorant people to cut their throat with, that is loss of their happiness. But you have no middle course; it must be “yea, yea, or nay, nay.” The same rule is applicable in a society which has taken centuries to perfect, in a community the most civilized, and where morality is at the highest pitch and as pure as it can be; you say the same rule must apply in a country the most degraded, in a society the most loose, and amongst a people just emerging from the shade of barbarism n whose I morals may be the lowest in the world. You say there is no middle course with l you. With the Saviour himself He would have found a way to suit existing circumstances and allowed time to do the work. I feel that I am rushing into a thing which will surely land me and the poor woman into a complete wreck of happiness. If my wife had not been completely made to take your view of the matter and had I been a complete master of the occasion, as it had been mine before she became a member and was stuffed with this precious marriage, I would most certainly use my right as a man; and refuse the thing point blank. But she is entirely for it; and as I myself cannot be admitted into the Wesleyan body as you tell me, without first entering into the church marriage, I cannot do anything else but give my consent thereto. Let it be done as speedily as possible.’ </p> 

<p>‘I must certainly say’, replied Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>, ‘that you unnecessarily entertain a most gloomy view of the case. You will find that if happiness was ensured you in your native marriage, double happiness will be the result of this one. Be assured that it would conduce to your happiness.’ </p> 

<p>‘You have not been long in the country, Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span>, to know the state of its society. In this instance you in this part have taken the one from Mr <span class="personal-name-4">Pritzia</span>. We have known each other long enough, for you to know that, besides being a man of some education, I have had English principles ingrafted into me. You also know Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> to be a woman of no education and that her principles are purely native. How can you entertain the hope that you have just expressed to me? Being illiterate, and hardly understanding English, could you expect her to realize the seriousness of the step which she is now about to take. Let it be hoped however that you may be right and I wrong as to the result of the marriage. If during the discussion of this matter I have said anything out of the way kindly forgive me; for I really cannot help myself as I felt during the time and even now that I am rushing or being forced into an abyss where there is no way of getting out once in. Remember me in your prayers my dear friend for I am really miserable. May God help us.’ </p> 

<p>Nothing more was said about the matter, and the Rev gentleman left not feeling very happy about the result of the conversation he had with his friend. As for Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> himself his position in the affair was then the same. He met the parson with a mind fully made up to enter into the new marriage, but he wished to let him know that he entered into it with his eyes wide open. It is true that to him the FUTURE was unfathomable a puzzle; but he found consolation in the thought that God could temper the wind for the shorn lamb. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> therefore felt, when the person went away, rather glad than otherwise that the matter was settled, even if it was against his good judgment. Poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>! better it would have been by far for you and Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> had you made a resolute stand and refused to have anything to do with the marriage. Your after life would have been happier in the society of your lady love instead of the heart burnings, misery, inquietude and the life of annoyance and irritation you would have afterwards Let this be a lesson to those who are living in ‘single life’ or in the happy marriage of their country?"  </p>

 <h4><p>Western Echo, 7th August 1886 </p></h4>

<p> It has been recorded somewhere that <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> at the meeting that took place between himself and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> exhibited such extreme disapproval of the step his friend was about to take, that he spoke in undisguised terms his sentiments or mind on the rashness of the act, and that he cautioned him before he left io think over the matter again before he plunged himself into it. The meeting of the friends took place shortly after the conference which has been related as having taken place between Mr <span class="personal-name-19">Powers</span> and Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. It was impossible, therefore for him to arrive at any other conclusion than that which resulted at the meeting. He consequently told his friend when they next met of his having made up his mind to take the leap in the dark and abide by the consequences. <span class="personal-name-3">Bonsoe Penin</span> had done all that a friend could do; he could not overstep the bounds of friendship and act the despotic master towards a refractory f slave; he therefore tendered <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> his services and even offered to act as his best man, which office he performed creditably when the marriage was solemnized shortly after. There were no cooings for Mr and Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>; they, as lovers, had done their cooings long, long ago; there was no honey-moon, nor any of the sweet nothings that newly married couples usually indulge in. To them nothing new was brought about by this new marriage. If anything was brought, it amounted to the two terms Mr and Mrs. </p> 

<p>Dear Miss <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>! Fain would I still call thee by thine own sweet name! May Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> never have occasion to regret the loss of her liberty, as she seems now not to regret the loss of her poetic name! Fare thee well sweet <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>! may the name <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> which thou hast assumed be as propitious to thee as that was to thee which thou hast cast away. And now gentle <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, to thee also I have aught to say of advice, give strict attention to it, and it will be of the greatest benefit to thee in the new life thou art going to lead. It is certain that thou art aware of the importance of the step thou hast taken, and that thy <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span> does not understand it. It would be thy duty therefore to be forbearing and to exercise greater patience with her now than thou ever didst before. If you wish to be happy, learn to lead her gently in the new path she has entered into with you. She has a great deal to learn and much to unlearn; be a willing preceptor, and in the end, as you are aware that she is quick to learn, success will Attend your endeavours and happiness will be your reward. I will tell you a ' story that was told me some years ago by an old man from which you will gain ''wholesome lessons and valuable advice.</p>  

 

<h2><p> CHAPTER IX </p></h2> 

<h3><p>THE STORY OF THE OLD MAN </p></h3> 

<h4><p>Western Echo, 7th August 1886 (continued)</p></h4>  

 

<p>I have been’, began the old man ‘a great traveller in my life. There is not country, a town of any note, in this vast continent of ours that I have not visited. The motives which first impelled me to be on the continual move I need no tell thee now; but for that motive I would not have travelled but certainly would have remained quiet at home, and lived among a people who honoured and respected me, as I was their chief. To look at me now you would not think that I could have been what I now represent myself to be, and yet such was truly the case. It happened one day as I was on my way to a certain town I fell in with a company of travellers who were going to the same place where I intended to rest for the night; we accordingly travelled together and from them I learnt that the great city for which I was bound - a city renowned for the splendour and magnificence of its buildings and for the great and prodigious amount of traffic carried on by its people with the adjacent as well as with the neighbouring countries as also for the great wisdom of its King was a three day journey from where I was. As I had heard much about this city and the wealth of its inhabitants, and as travellers were generally loud in their praises of that spot, 1 fully made up my mind to see it. This resolution was moreover the outcome of a desire to become acquainted with the superior manners, habits and customs of the inhabitants of the city. We reached a small town near it about dusk and having had a good rest during the night, I got up the next morning quite fresh and was in readiness to embrace the chance of a party of men who were going to that city with merchandize to sell. Although I had nothing in the shape of goods to sell yet my anxiety to reach the place as quickly as possible equalled that of the merchants; we therefore took two and a half instead of three days to accomplish the journey. I was fortunate enough to be conducted to good lodgings, the proprietor of which was very kind and civil to me. He took a great liking to me, and in course of time we became as thick friends as similarity of age - for we were about 30 years old then - temperament, and habits could make us. I am just turning to 65 years, so it is about 35 years since this happened. There was something in me which the man doubtless saw. He probably believed that if he cultivated an intimacy with me it would be to our mutual benefit. He subsequently engaged me in his business. As I had an aptitude for business, especially the kind of business in which he was engaged, he in course of time had occasion to thank his stars for having had my assistance, and I for having become acquainted with him, for his business increased and he soon had occasion to enlarge his establishment by adding new buildings to it, and engaging another one equally large to which he transferred me. In this situation I soon h contracted an acquaintance with people of note and good standing in the city. I J’ took to myself a tutor from whom I learnt a great deal of what I was before ignorant and acquired such habits as only highly civilized communities could impart. My business did not only increase but prospered. I became a man of note and associated with the highest personages in the city. Things went on smoothly with me for many years, when one day, being seized with a great inclination to visit my native country, I took leave of my friend the proprietor to whom I entrusted the management of my affairs during my absence and from whom I departed with a good portion of the riches I had acquired, carried by many men and women and accompanied by some of my friends, who were desirous of seeing my country and people. I need not trouble you with a description of the nature of the reception I received From my people; suffice it to say that I did not repent having made the journey and my friends for accompanying me. For some years I remained with my people, during which time I introduced many improvements, effected changes in the habits and customs of my country and made such laws which I considered suitable to its circum- stances. After I had done all that was possible to be done I went back to my adopted country and found my friend the proprietor, completely changed in disposition, although not from a worldly point of view. He received me very warmly, and not a little to my surprise introduced me to a lady whom he called his wife. I experienced feelings of chillness during the time I was with my friend and his lady. Instead of the jolly friend I left a few years ago I met him ' looking rather haggard and miserable and I saw moreover that his civil manners towards me were forced "left Mn very much surprised and perplexed. I did not know what to think of him. I felt somewhat grieved. His friendship and love for me I could perceive had not in any way abated, but yet I felt a coldness, a numbness, which I could not make out. In this situation I took my leave of them but determined to get at the cause of this extraordinary change, and in future to shape my conduct towards him.  </p>

<h4>Western Echo, 24th August 1886 </h4> 

<p>As soon as I reached home, I wrote a letter inviting him to a quiet dinner with me and to have a friendly talk with him afterwards. But just as I was handing the letter to a servant for delivery my dear friend was announced and a moment after, he ran in and embraced me in the most rapturous manner. He was himself again. I squeezed him to my heart and lost in the long embrace the cold reception I received from him in his own house. </p>

<p> ‘After dinner we withdrew to a room inaccessible to any body else in the house and where if I entered nobody was to be admitted by any servants. It was a room beautifully furnished according to the taste of the country. When we seated ourselves my friend thus commenced.  “My dear friend!! I need not tell you how deeply I felt the manner in which I was obliged to receive you the other day after long years of separation. If I tell you that it was on account of the woman to whom I introduced you as my wife ’ I am sure you would not believe it. It is true nevertheless. If you expect to see me as the same open, frank and kind hearted friend and jovial fellow you will be sadly mistaken. Never was a man so completely transformed as I have been since the d—1 incarnate and his spouse darkened my door with their accursed presence:30 (excuse the expression) but I will be even with them yet, that is if I happen to meet them anywhere. I have determined to follow them even to the end of the world to be avenged, the accursed meddlers! Would you believe that I and my beautiful<span class="personal-name-7">Abigail</span>31 were having one of our usual rows when you were announced? ana do you now wonder at the nature of the reception I gave you? That moment I felt that I could kill that woman outright and be hung for jt. but your presence put a stop to the row thereby saving me. I must beg you to pardon me for the incoherent way in which I have expressed myself; I-really can- not help myself.” Here he stopped to collect his thoughts and cool his excited spirit, and then commenced thus: - “You must be aware that before you left me in order to proceed to your country I was living in single blissfulness; I was a happy man then. Shortly after your departure desiring to fill the vacancy which your absence occasioned I thought that I could do no better than to take to myself a companion; for a friend of less degree than that could not compensate me for the loss I had sustained by your being away from me. It was not long before I found in the woman who is now my wife all that I could desire. We were married according to our own custom which gives either of us liberty to disconnect ourselves from each other should we find that instead of the marriage creating happiness which is the chief aim of such unions it created misery. For more than two years neither of us had cause to repent the change we had made in our former lives. Neither of us would change the other for another companion, so perfect was our happiness. But no happiness in this world could be called perfect; none would last long without any alloy, and ours came from a source we the least expected. A man exceedingly prepossessing appearance and This wife' came and took lodgings in our house as he looked very respectable we gave them the best apartments. The business that brought them to the city was to introduce a new kind of Religion. The doctrines they preached were such as it seemed the people were ripe to embrace. Among the customs which this worthy couple tried to introduce was the marriage rite. This found a great number of advocates in the ranks of our women: they must be married according to the rites this new religion contemplated; and among these female advocates my wife was the most zealous and no wonder, since she and the female lodger of mine had become firm friends. You know my dear friend that I hate every thing that has an innovating influence, and I need not tell you that I was the leader of those men who set up their hearts against this interference in our marriage custom, although in every other doctrine they introduced I was in accord with them especially polygamy. Mr Baptista" (my lodger's name) had a great liking for me; he would make a proselyte of me he used to say; and but for his interference in our marriage custom I certainly would have been a strenuous discipline of his. To make a long story short my wife became unhappy; nothing short of the solemnization of our marriage to the new religion would satisfy her. Domestic infelicity is outrageous, and I caught it. Besides which, I was assisted every day by Mr and Mrs Baptista; 'set an exam- le bright for others to follow and thou shalt be rewarded', they used to tell me and they were right; for am I not rewarded!! Well, it is no use crying over spilt milk. In short with my eyes wide open, I suffered myself to be bamboozled and the marriage was again solemnized. Thus I woefully changed substance for a shadow, happiness for misery; and you return to meet your dear jovial friend the most wretched man living. My wife, the obedient loving girl, the pride of my life, the solace of my evil days is turned into the very incarnation of a curse in my own house and I cannot send her away on account of the oath I took at the ceremony. As the surviving twin-brother - whom nature had attached together - was obliged to carry about his poor dead brother with him wherever he went so I am doomed by my oath to carry this incubus, this woman about with me. </p> 

<p>""Can it be possible", I asked, "that you cannot send her away in spite of all the misery which probably may result in your premature death?" </p>

<p>""No," my friend replied, "unless either she or I commit adultery which I will not do if I can help myself."</p> 

<p>"But I am afraid you have not told me about this new kind of marriage," I asked my friend. "For I do not see how it could change the amiable disposition of a woman like your wife when she was living with you as a country wife, to one of so acrimonious or acidulous a nature, as you tell me, in her second or the new marriage?" </p>

<p>""I thought it was not necessary," my friend replied. "There were many advantages held out to them (the women) in this new marriage, but the greatest among these advantages which takes their fancy the most is in the fact that she and her children begotten by me or she alone in the absence of children become entitled to my property should she survive me, whilst she on the other hand has got nothing to leave me were I to survive her. This coupled with the fact that you cannot send her away and other advantages this marriage gives gives, has made her so proud and unbearably independent of the man who has made her what she is that at times I have even conceived a notion of killing her and myself to end my misery.” </p>  

<p>“My dearest friend, and benefactor,” rejoined I, cut to the very heart with grief and sorrow, “I would most willingly, if I could, share your grief with you, but that is impossible. If I could restore you the happiness which you have lost, by sacrificing all that I possess, I would most willingly throw it to the winds so that you might be what you were before, but it is utterly impossible as you lead me to understand. But you can learn to endure what you cannot help. In perplexity and distress both of mind and body, it is only the wise who. forbear and are patient, and in the very forbearance and patience that they exercise learn the way how to get out of the difficulty. Both of you I can see have not lost the love subsisting between you; in spite of her sour disposition and ill behaviour towards you, which is the offspring of the union of barbarous ideas with civilized notions; of imperfect knowledge of the new doctrines with the old customs. I can find that she loves you as ardently as ever she did before or else why should she wish to tie herself to you for life? It is in this very love that you can effect a reconciliation and bring her to the knowledge of her duty towards you.”</p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 11th September 1886 </p></h4>  


<p>“In this your distress, will you be my <span class="personal-name-telemachus"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemachus" target="_blank">Telemachus</a></span> and I your Mentor.'4 That’s well. As soon as you leave me go direct home, and call upon your wife with those sweet smiles that were once your own and accost her. If she returns your smiles and meet you in the manner she ought, attempt to tell her something amusing. But if she meets your smiles with a scowls and your amicable advances with indifference and contempt go quietly to your own apartments and bolt or fasten the door which leads to hers and there seclude yourself from her. If possible take your meals alone; but you must prosecute your business without consulting her as I suppose you are in the habit of doing; in fact show her by your assumed manners that you intend in future to do without her altogether. In the meantime watch her narrowly; and if you find any sign of contrition and a wish to make advances towards you meet her halfway, observing at the same time whether she is sincere. If she is not yet what she ought to be, preserve your reserved manners, in addition to which you can go out frequently for strolls or come to me whenever you can afford the time. Entertain your friends as usual without taking any particular notice of her; in fact treat her as a perfect non entity when you are alone in the house; but when there is company treat her with distant and severe civility. This mode of treatment will excite in her a spirit of opposition if she is a passionate woman, and she may seek to kick up a row with you. To meet this effectually, and to prevent any more rows, be (contumelious/ and scornful in your treatment of her; in fact supreme contempt cannot fail to effect a cure. But if you still fail in your thus endeavouring to break her in, and bring to her a sense of her duty towards you, then I know of nothing more that could restore you to your happiness; and the sooner a judicious separation be obtained the better for both of you; for it is impossible that God who in creating us intended us to be happy with bin: in the other world should punish us, if we sought to restore a lost happiness which we cannot effect in any other way but by untying a knot which was made by human institution. On the other hand if she is contrite and appears to be desirous for a restitution of conjugal love and affection, cautiously meet her. To her ten advances make one; go in this way until you are sure that your wife is really yours again in disposition, and in general conduct. When you have brought her to such a condition speak to her thus:-</p>	 

<p> ‘“Before we were united together as man and wife, each of us was happy; we were extremely happy too together when we were united as one, in our first - marriage status - country marriage - for you honoured, loved and obeyed me then; in our second marriage, happiness took to itself wings and flew away, and both of us became miserable; I say both of us because you could not be happy & when you made me unhappy. Well as it was impossible to undo what had been done for us, neither could we jointly find felicity therein, I mean in this second marriage, I sought to be happy alone and succeeded right well. In that state as you are fully aware meant to remain had you not shown a spirit of contrition, and desired the restoration of conjugal rights and love. I may as well mention that after having lived separately in one house for some time without any prospect of our making up it was my intention to restore you to your former slate of happiness by sending you away to your people and to continue as I have already commenced in single blissfulness, since with you I could not be happy. But your contrition appears to me now to be sincere, and I therefore must give up what I resolved to do. Now I must tell you candidly that I wish immensely to be happy and I dare say you wish to be the same. Experience has taught both of us that before we knew ourselves and afterwards in our country marriage we were happy: but that it is only this untoward second marriage that has ruined our happiness. Do you wish to be happy? I know I wish to be! Well do you wish to be happy alone as we were before we knew each other? No? You wish to be happy with me then? Yes - Well you know which of these two kinds of marriage it was that brought us happiness. As you wish to be happy with me, do you intend to behave towards me in the second marriage which we cannot break on account of the oath that we took, in the same way as you did in the first? Yes - honour - bright? Yes. That you would strictly honour, love and obey me in everything as you did before? Yes? Now come and kiss me to seal our compact ‘  </p>

<p>“This is the way, my dear friend, in which I would break in a shrew of a wife if I happen to have any such thing. Observe all what I have told you, and if you really love your wife you will soon have her at your feet; but if, on the other hand, she is unworthy of you, you will in this way get rid of her quickly. I will not go to your house until the one or the other of these contingencies is brought about.” </p>

<p>‘My friend left me in good spirits, and I am glad to have to record that in less than a month he called and took me to his house, and there I found his wife sitting in sweet loveliness waiting for her husband and his friend whom she also expected. As soon as we entered the room, and before I accosted her, she got up and advanced a few steps towards me and then said “this is my husband’s only friend of whom I have heard so much; accept the sincerest apology that only a contrite heart could give. I feel keenly the wrong (nay insult) that I offered you at our first introduction. I know that you felt the insult as keenly as I feel it now, because you have not called here since. Say that you forgive me, and I will even be grateful to you. My husband has forgiven me; wont you also forgive me?” I took the proffered hand with the greatest alacrity, knelt down and kissed it, like a gallant man and in doing so dropped a tear which was. caused by great happiness. I need not say in conclusion that Mr and Mrs —became the happiest married couple 1 ever knew barring myself.' </p> 

<p>And now <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, to you I leave the story of the old man a£ a legacy; read, learn and inwardly digest.  Should you at any future time have occasion to repent of the step you have taken as the hero of this story have recourse to the same remedy and you will find it infallible.  </p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 26th September 1886</p></h4> 

<p> We have recorded that <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became a class member. His admittance into that Holy Society was hailed by every member thereof as the means by which many of the clique to which he belonged would be converted. At <span Class-"place-name-1">Dobblesie</span> he was set up as a bright example for others to follow, and prayers were offered for him to persist and continue in the good path that he had taken. Whilst the holy men hailed the conversion as they called it of <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>, those of his own clique and status in the country ridiculed him. Some gave him three months others more illiberal gave him only one to renounce attendance at class. Mr John Brandebolt, his most intimate friend and companion in all circumstances, had written from <span Class-"place-name-1">Dobblesie</span> about the impossibility of his remaining a class member long, and that if he continued in the society even one month he would consider it a prodigy, and he would forsake his aversion to the thing and join it too. Nothing daunted, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> made up his mind fully to stick to his resolution. He said to himself that if he as an individual could not derive real benefit or advantage as to his faith in and duty towards his god, and to his fellow creatures he nevertheless would do some good, and certainly no harm; he was therefore sincere in the course he had taken. Weeks passed and he was a constant attendant at the meeting; he was unremitting in his performance of the duties connected with his new position; yet he narrowly watched the conduct of the members and the minister who was the leader, both in the meetings and in their general conduct. The result of his observation was not favourable to the cause. A man who scrupled not to commit any kind of sin so long as he was not seen by his fellow creatures became immediately a saint at the meetings. One member particularly who was more zealous than the rest since it devolved upon him to perform the duty of conducting the class at any time the leader was away was known to have maintained certain illicit relations with the wife of a friend of his although married himself. This intercourse he carried on as openly as he possibly could. Everybody believed the scandal; it was only the professed christians who would not believe it. The Husband of the woman felt the insult keenly and remonstrated with the wife, but she denied it stoutly; so also did the man. An open rupture broke out, and the woman in assumed innocence felt insulted and therefore removed her things, from her liege lord's house to the house of her paramour A scandalous deed so openly acknowledged, at least on the part of the woman, and tacitly on the part of the man could not be believed by those who had assumed to themselves the garb of righteousness. It was impossible for a man of his position in the society to commit a crime so wicked and so openly too. A few days after, the woman removed her things to her own family house; shortly after she gave birth to a child; and that child was acknowledged not by the husband for he knew it was not his, but by the man of 'reputed integrity' who was then a class member. Shortly after this at a meeting the man in saying his feelings, exclaimed 'How very hard it is for me without my wife to worship my God!' 'Yes' returned the leader, 'it is really hard, but per- sist in your prayers, so that God may give you grace to combat the world, the flesh, and the devil.' That was all; no question was raised by him as to the part he took as a principal in the scandal, neither was he to my knowledge reprimanded and degraded. An act so glaringly hostile to the spirit in which that good society was first instituted by that godly man (Mr Wesley) did not fail to open the eyes of our hero; but when the conduct of the minister was added and still more a scandal of the same nature in high quarters was bruited about, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> felt that instead of being benefited by his connection with the holy class, he would be only learning the art or sin of hypocrisy; an acquisition which would place him in a worse position with his Maker than he was in before he joined the Class; he made his mind to leave them. His attendance at the meetings became at first slack and finally he abandoned it altogether. He assigned no particular reason for his conduct when the minister asked him, only that it did not agree with him. <span class="personal-name">Qauibu</span> in consequence lost all confidence in the good faith of a good number of the class going gentlemen and ladies; he could not help knowing that many of them made a cloak of the sacred institution to hide crimes which non class members would not presume to commit if they could help themselves. There are certainly some very good and pious men amongst them, but they are few as compared with the hypocritical members Whose only object in joining class seems to be to find a garb of security Tor the sins they intend to commit. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> separated himself from this society; but Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> strenuously adhered to it. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> saw the dark side of this separate institution, class meetings - still darker; but his wife only saw its bright side still brighter; in fact the only path that could lead her to heaven our hero only saw hypocrisy written in large letters in the countenances of the forward members who for a put pose of their own make themselves conspicuous in the Society; but our heroine on her part saw only excessive piety, goodness and gentleness written in their faces, and so in their general habits. In fine, <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> would none of them, but those who wish to do good, and consider themselves sinners and as such do not turn up their noses against their fellow creatures who may be just as good if not better in the sight of the Great Searcher of hearts; but Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> has taken them all indiscriminately to be her brothers and sisters, and their people her people. Thus Mr and Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> became separate in their ideas, in the class of people they associated with; the lady taking her husband to be ungodly since he was not a class goer; and the man feeling daily that his wife was not to him the same as she was; and that they were being estranged in their low, in their habits, and in the pleasure they once had in each other’s society.  </p>

<h4><p>Western Echo, 9th October 1886 </p></h4> 

<p>It was thus they were relatively situated when they removed to <span Class-"place-name-1">Dobblesie</span>, among their own people. <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had hoped that a change for the better would have taken place in their circumstances by the influence of the kind of society there was at <span Class-"place-name-1">Dobblesie</span>, but it seemed to him afterwards that they had jumped from the frying pan into the fire. He felt that he must join class again in order to make his wife acknowledge him as a fit associate in a spiritual sense; but that was impossible; so they drifted asunder in the same way as when they were at <span Class-"place-name-2">Gangacre</span>: the distance between them was widening a pace. Each found no pleasure in the society which delighted the other. Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> could not very well move in the society which her husband naturally kept, since English was the only language used; neither could the husband move in the society kept by the lady for reasons Already assigned. Can it be wondered at that their domestic intercourse became somewhat constrained and forced? There was no more welcome breathed out so softly and lovingly for Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> when he returned home from an absence of some duration. Oh, how keenly did he feel his position! It would have been by far better if he had never met the woman; or when he did, that he had never bothered about church marriage, the sole cause of the ruin of their happiness, since if their union was purely native, which was just as legal, the woman would never dare act as she did; but he could not very well blame his wife. Positioned as she was, inexperienced as to civilized society, and uneducated so as to find out the right way herself, by reading the bible or other good books, she entirely depended upon what she was told or instructed by members of her society; she would not believe her husband when he attempted to elucidate parts of ‘the good book’ to her; so wicked had she been taught to consider her husband that nothing that he would tell her she would for a moment consider to be reliable if once the least of these worthies told her the contrary. In the midst of an interesting conversation with her husband if any of these brothers or sisters called in she would at once leave him and go to him or her. Scores of other evils too tedious to enumerate and sprung up between them. The woman had lost honour and respect for the man in some matters, even obedience, for no other reason but because, forsooth, he would not make a hypocrite out of himself. Poor <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>! how very much he regretted having allowed his wife to join a society which had brought nothing but misery to him and to the woman too. None of his friends would sympathize with him. ‘It serves him right,’ they would tell him. He really had sown the storm and was reaping the whirlwind with a vengeance. At home he felt no comfort; at the homes of his friends he felt the same; for did he not remember in their homes what he had lost in his! </p> 

<p>At first good breeding and delicate feelings would prevent him from interfering with his wife, but the lady would not or rather could not see that it was through sheer respect for himself and for her which prevented him from taking active interference. Observance of punctiliousness any longer, he felt, would be an injury to himself and his dear but erring wife. He made up his mind therefore to speak to her seriously and to the point.  </p>

<p>An opportunity soon offered itself. Mrs <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> had gone to ‘prayer meeting’ and came home a long time after the meeting had broken up. To suspect his wife of libidinous conduct it was impossible; but still he could not help thinking that she was going too far. He sat up late for her; and as soon as she came home, and after she had taken off her things he called her in and the following conversation took place between them. </p>

<p> I have sat for you long to-night <span class="personal-name-2">Wissah</span>,’ began Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>. Where did you go to?’ ‘Why do you ask me?’ she replied. ‘You know that I could go no where else to night but to a prayer meeting. If you had gone there you would have seen me. But why did you sit up for me? You had no occasion to do so Mr <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span>! I have every right to sit up even to the small hours of the morning, so as to question a wife who chooses to keep away from home without the husband s knowing her whereabouts. Where did you go to? I beg to repeat the question.  </p>

<p>‘Have I not told you that I went to the prayer meeting?’  </p>

 <p>‘But you have just come home,’ he rejoined. ‘It is more than an hour since the meeting broke up.’</p>  

<p>‘Yes, but what of that? Can I not go out without being suspected?’ asked she rather impertinently. </p> 

<p>‘What of it you ask?’ cried <span class="personal-name">Quaibu</span> somewhat nettled. ‘It means this, my dear girl, that after the meeting was over, you went somewhere else and I mean to know where you went to. ’ </p> 

<p>‘Oh, you are jealous,’ said she tauntingly and at the same time smiling.  </p>
